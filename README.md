## Project Description:

The project is about implementing a Skier-Routing app using `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `Node.js`. The project is Web-based app, but targeted towards mobile phone.

**Please note that, project description is subjected to change.**

## Project Background:

Many of the modern ski areas are widespread with dozens of chair-lifts/gondolas, sometimes up-to hundreds of kilometres of ski slopes and many dining establishments. The app will help the avid skier to find the best way to get from point A to a point B. The slopes are of different difficulty (blue, red and black) and the skier, depending on confidence/ability level, should be able to specify which slopes to use. In a normal situation, moving up will involve lifts and the skiers will ski down the slope. But in some cases, the skier may decide to take the lift down (e.g., if the only available slope is a challenging black one). The app should also help the skier to find the right food place and public restrooms. The app will determine the location of the skier.
